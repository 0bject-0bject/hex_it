# HEX_IT

## Description
This is a simple hex viewer and editor written in rust. This is fairly basic, I tried to use as little packages as possible!

## Usage
```
hex-it -p <file>

Options:
    -p<file>    Path to file to open
    -h          Print this help message
```

(type help once you open the file and read the commands)

## Building
```
cargo build --release

# To install
cargo install --path .
```

```
cargo install hex_it
```
